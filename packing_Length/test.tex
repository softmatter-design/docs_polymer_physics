The Packing Length 
In effect, p can be likened to the molecular diameter of the repeat unit in a polymer chain. A mental picture of the meaning of p can be gained in the following way. The packing length, as noted, is defined as 

\begin{equation}
    p-\dfrac{M}{\langle R^2 \rangle_0 \rho N_a}
\end{equation}
Equation (1A) can also be expressed in terms of Flory’s characteristic ratio as 

The average volume of a chain per bond is given as 

Thus, the packing length can be expressed as 

The parameter V 
, where h represents the diameter of a cylinder of length  
0 
swept out 
by the chain repeat unit. 

Thus, 

where the product C 
 
 
0 
is the Kuhn step length 
l. One can thus think of a chain as being made up of freely jointed rods of length l = C and diameter h. The packing length is thus proportional to the ratio of the cross-sectional area to the length of each rod. Hence, the smaller h is with respect to the skinnier the chain and the smaller p and Vb
